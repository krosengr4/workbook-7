---JOINING TABLES IN QUERIES---

- INNER JOIN
    - Where a row in one table is joined with a row in another table
    - *Only matched rows will be included in the result
    - ex: SELECT employee.id, first_name, last_name, description, min_val, max_val
          FROM employee
          JOIN pay_grade
          ON employee.pay_grade_id = pay_grade.id;

- OUTER JOIN
    - Used when we might want rows in one table that don't match rows in the other table
    - Do this by creating a LEFT OUTER JOIN or a RIGHT OUTER JOIN
        - LEFT OUTER JOIN
            - The FIRST table doesn't require matching data to be included
        - RIGHT OUTER JOIN
            - The SECOND table doesn't require matching data to be included

        - ex: SELECT order.id, sold_date, name, email
              FROM order
              LEFT JOIN customer
              ON order.customer_id = customer.id;
