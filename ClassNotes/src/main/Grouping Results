---GROUPING RESULTS---

- GROUP BY clause allows you to execute aggregate functions on groups of data
    - ex: SELECT column1, column2, etc
          FROM table_name
          WHERE condition
          GROUP BY column_name(s)
          ORDER BY column_name(s);

- Renaming Computed Fields
    - Using AS you can create an alias for the column name
        - ex: SELECT rental_id, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
              FROM sakila.payment
              GROUP BY rental_id
              ORDER BY rental_id;
    - You can also use AS to create an alias for a table name
        - ex: SELECT rating, AVG(rental_rate) AS avg_rate
              FROM film
              GROUP BY rating
              ORDER BY avg_rating;

- HAVING is used with GROUP BY to include only those groups that meet a specified condition
    - ex: SELECT column1, columns2, etc
          FROM table_name
          WHERE row-condition
          GROUP BY column_name(s)
          HAVING group-condition
          ORDER BY column_name(s);
    - If WHERE is used to select rows, HAVING is to select groups
        - ex: SELECT rating, COUNT(*)
              FROM film
              GROUP BY rating
              HAVING COUNT(*) >= 200
              ORDER BY rating;
