        - (ex: "SELECT column 1, column 3) or (ex: "SELECT *) for all columns"
    - It also needs a FROM (the table to get data from)
        - ex: "FROM (keyword)

- Optional clauses in a SELECT statement
    - ORDER BY specifies which order to return the rows
    - WHERE specifies which rows to return
        - Uses comparison operators (=, >, <, <=...)
        - Build complex condition using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
        -
        - The LIKE allows you to perform a custom string comparison
        - ex: WHERE title LIKE sit%
        -
        - SELECT DISTINCT statement only returns unique values
        - ex: SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2...
        FROM table_name;



    - AS to provide an alias for a column or expression
